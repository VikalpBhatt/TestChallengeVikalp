# Method & Approach 
```
I have used docker-compose to solve this problem. Have taken docker images of all three tiers - front-end using AngularJS, backend as Java Spring Boot and Database as MongoDB. Application is designed to let the user enter employee details and then shows them in a tabular form on the same screen.

To run follow below steps-

Login to GCP platform, set the projectID.
Open GCP CLI and give ./Challenge1-bash.sh.
Bash script will install the respective dependecies.
Launch the external URL of the VM and you will see the homepage.

May not be the best optimal solution but have tried my best with limited time. Other approached include 
using Terraform to create resources runtime or using a typical 3-tier architecture using ASP.net or similar.
